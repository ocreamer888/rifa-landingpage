i need to create a landingpage for selling 500 tickets using react, tailwind, next.js and supabase. Latest versions of each. 



The landing page must:

- be connected to supabase and update information instantly
- Each ticket is going to have an specific number between 1 and 500
- let users pick any number of tickets they want to buy
- show updated information like:
  1. how many tickets are available
  2. how many tickets have been sold
- user friendly
- use supabase to store data about payments




The landing page can't:

- let users buy already sold tickets
- show sold tickets as available
- show available tickets as sold
